Recently, I had the chance to attend the 2017 Grace Hopper Conference in Orlando, Florida. Alongside all the amazing talks, interesting keynotes and new tech demos was a massive career fair that I have ever seen. Among the companies that attended was Wayfair, an online website hosting home décor, along with furniture, outdoor accessories and the like. Upon speaking with a Wayfair representative, I noticed that they had VR headset displayed at their booth. Wayfair, among many other companies, have been slowly integrating VR and AR into their shopping catalogs. <br>
AR and VR have made a huge entrance into consumer products in the last few years. We’ve seen an influx of VR headsets being sold to the masses. In fact, the last time I attended the Grace Hopper conference in 2015, Google was giving out Google Cardboards to all the patrons that attended the career fair. It is interesting to see the areas that have adopted the use of this new technology. Multiple furniture stores have taken up the use of AR to allow individuals to “preview” the furniture they are interested in purchasing by using an application that will scan the room and drop 3D models of the furniture in their catalog into the user’s room through the camera. Ikea recently released an app called Ikea Place which aims to do the very same thing. I played around with their catalog, previewing a wastebasket in my own bedroom.

In addition, I put some furniture in some odd places, like a few chairs on the sidewalk outside my apartment. <br>

Though the app was a little buggy, I think it did a pretty remarkable job of previewing the material I would possibly buy. In fact, I was tempted to buy some of the more expensive furniture for my room just because I was so entertained by visually seeing the product in my room that I barely took time to stop and contemplate the price of the products. One of the biggest issues with buying furniture is being able to see how it stands up in a room. I remember when my parents bought a living room set and brought it home only to find out that none of it fit in our room, causing us to have to move and return heavy, bulky amounts of furniture. If this app were available back then, it would have given us the insight right away, saving us time, energy, and money. <br>
I believe that AR could be used for many purposes besides seeing the fit of furniture in my room. As technology increases, we’ll probably be seeing a lot more of these apps being used for more complex consumer goods, such as makeup and beauty. An individual could scan their face and see exactly how a certain color of foundation will look on their skin, or preview their hair before getting it dyed a specific color. Perhaps Tide would start showing how your clothes would look with frequent uses of their detergent over the competitors. Dentists could better sell braces by showing an individual what their face would look like if they decided to pay for orthodontics. <br>
Beyond consumer goods, urban planners, architects, and civil engineers could visualize possible problems with their solutions with buildings by producing AR versions of the buildings they plan on creating.
