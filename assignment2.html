For this assignment, we were to choose some text found around us in a different language and utilize Google Translate to translate the text from the foreign language to English. In this case, I used the preparation instructions on a popular variation of Nesquik called ChocoMilk. The instructions on this powdered drink mix are written in both English and Spanish, so I thought it would be a good way to compare the technology to the translations themselves. Though the technology is imperfect, it is a perfect signifier of very forward-thinking, progressive technology that I believe will revolutionize many aspects of life as we know it. I think this capability would be most effectively used in a situation where a user has an AR device such as Google Glass, because traveling to foreign countries would become much, much easier. In the case of this being ran on a future pair of AR lenses or contacts, I believe this would have an amazing amount of functionalities, specifically in travel and purchasing other foods and even browsing different websites. Nowadays, Google translate can sometimes translate web pages effectively, and food nutrition facts and product ingredient labels will have multiple copies of the same text in different languages. However, being able to just use an advanced version of this translating mechanism would solve most of those issues, allowing all languages to be used in whatever language they are in, since there will be technology doing the translating for us.

There is an important aspect that is being brought up when mentioning the idea of using AR or contact lenses and having all the original text in the real world being hidden. On the plus side, this would allow people to efficiently get messages instead of having to wait and translate and possibly misinterpret them. However, there is also the possibility that such technology could be hacked, and an improper translation or maliciously false translation of some text could result in catastrophic disasters if people are not careful.

I think that there should be a before and after of the mapping. The way that Google Translate worked, there were multiple iterations of the text. I think that saving an end file and keeping the original would allow people to have some sort of control as to whether they think that they want to heed the translation or not. This issue is valid considering the issues that have occurred with individuals using Google Maps. People who use Google Maps use less of their brain activity thinking about driving since they don’t have to actively think about driving. This causes their brain to go on auto-pilot. It is easy to infer that the same kind of thing could happen to someone using translating technology without thinking about the repercussions or without utilizing critical thinking. Being able to put the control in the user’s hands causes the user to think more critically about their decision and actively encourages a separation between AR and real life.
